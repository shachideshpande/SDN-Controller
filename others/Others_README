	shows Real_Time_Status as explained above.
	here,
		Real_Time_Status[2][2] = {010,101,010,00000111,1} represents the following.
		src of this message is 010 that is node 2.
		destination of this message is 101 that is node 5.
		curr  is the node in which this message is currently at. that is this message is at node 010 (node 2)
		idk is the unique id of this message that is 00000111 that is 7.
		k is application priority of this message that is 1

	shows the NextHop matrix, where NH(i)(j) shows the next hop node for packet going from node i to node j, calculated by shortest path algorithm.

	Here, consider 2nd row of NH matrix, that is the 1st node. 
	The values are (000,001,010,010,101,101,101,111)
	Thus the next hop node from path from node 1 to node 1 (i.e. to itself ) is node 001 ( i.e. node 1 itself).
	again, next hop node for path from nde 1 to say node 4 is node 101, i.e. node 5.
	In this way, path of node 1 to node 'i' is denoted by i-th entry of this row corresponding to node 1.

	Similarly Matrix A above it shows adjacency matrix as input.
	If the entry A(i,j) is '1', then there is an edge between the i-th and j-th node.
	For example, A(4) is the row corresponding to 4th node. The entry is 01111000, i.e from this node, you can reach the 3,4,5,6 nodes by direct edge. ( note that we are indexing right to left ).
